# FOREVER Landing Page — Simple Build Plan (Japan-Aligned)

**Focus:** Trust, Clarity, and Sustainable Conversion (Japan Market)  
**Scope:** One high-performing landing page, education-first.

---

## Purpose of This Document

This document defines the **Japan-specific implementation** of the FOREVER landing page.  
It preserves the original simplicity and speed principles while adapting the funnel logic to **Japanese user behavior and trust requirements**.

This file **does not replace** the global build plan. It is a **market variant**.

---

## Phase 1: Strategy & Content (The "What")

### 1. Define the Core

- **Primary Goal (Japan):**  
  → User submits their email to receive an educational aloe guide.

- **Secondary Goal:**  
  → User proceeds to product exploration or checkout after education.

- **Persona (1 sentence):**  
  Health-conscious, risk-averse Japanese adult evaluating daily wellness habits.

- **Offer:**  
  Educational PDF explaining aloe quality, process, and daily usage.

---

### 2. Funnel Logic (Japan Version)

Every section on the page must serve **one** of the following roles:

1. **[E] Educate**  
   Explain aloe, quality control, and daily-use context.

2. **[T] Trust**  
   Demonstrate longevity, manufacturing control, and process transparency.

3. **[L] Lead**  
   Offer a useful, non-promotional educational asset.

4. **[C] Convert (Secondary)**  
   Allow product access only after trust is established.

> Note: Direct selling without education is intentionally avoided for Japan.

### 3. Copy Rules (Japan)

- Neutral, factual tone
- No urgency language
- No exaggerated benefits
- Explain "why" before "what"

CTA examples:
- 「無料ガイドを見る」
- 「資料を受け取る」

---

## Phase 2: Design & Assets (The "Look")

### 4. Wireframe Logic

Mobile-first vertical stack:

Hero → Trust/Process → Context/Problem → Solution → Proof → Lead Capture → Secondary CTA → Footer

Key differences vs global:
- Trust sections expanded
- Lead capture precedes product offer

---

### 5. Visual Principles (Japan)

- White or off-white background
- Muted natural colors
- High readability typography
- Minimal iconography with explanation text

No aggressive contrast outside the primary CTA.

---

## Phase 3: Build (The "Code")

### 6. Tech Stack

- Same as global plan (HTML/CSS or lightweight framework)
- Forms optimized for minimal friction

No popups. No auto-play elements.

---

### 7. Non-Negotiables

- Mobile usability
- Load time < 2 seconds
- Clear legal footer
- Clear privacy explanation near form

---

## Phase 4: Launch & Learn

### 8. Go Live

- Deploy Japan-specific URL or subpath
- Test lead capture flow end-to-end

---

### 9. Iterate (Japan Metrics)

After ~100 visitors:

- Low scroll → Improve Hero clarity
- Scroll, no form submit → Improve trust/process explanation
- Form submit, no purchase later → Improve follow-up education

Change **one variable at a time**.

---

## Key Constraint (Do Not Ignore)

Japan is a **trust-first market**.  
Speed without credibility is wasted speed.

This plan optimizes for **long-term conversion**, not impulse sales.
