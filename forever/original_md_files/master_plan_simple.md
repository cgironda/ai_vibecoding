# FOREVER Landing Page — Simple Build Plan (Lite)
**Focus:** Speed, Clarity, and Conversion.
**Scope:** One high-performing landing page.

---

## Phase 1: Strategy & Content (The "What")

### 1. Define the Core
*   **Goal:** What is the ONE thing we want them to do? (e.g., "Buy the Starter Kit")
*   **Persona:** Who is this for? (Write it in 1 sentence).
*   **Offer:** What exactly do they get?

### 2. The "3-Stage" Funnel Logic
Every section on the page must do one of these three things:
1.  **[E] Educate:** "Here is the problem you have and the new way to solve it."
2.  **[P] Persuade:** "Here is the proof (reviews, science, mechanism) that it works."
3.  **[S] Sell:** "Here is the offer and how to buy it now."

### 3. Copy Drafting
*   **Headline:** Clear benefit, not clever slogan.
*   **Body:** Focus on "You" (the user), not "We" (the company).
*   **CTA:** Single, distinct action button (e.g., "Get Forever Now").

## Phase 2: Design & Assets (The "Look")

### 4. Visuals
*   **Wireframe:** Mobile-first. Stack the sections: Hero -> Problem -> Solution -> Proof -> Offer -> CTA.
*   **Assets:** Collect real photos/videos. No generic stock photos.
*   **Design:** Clean, readable typography. High contrast for the CTA button.

## Phase 3: Build (The "Code")

### 5. Tech Stack (Simple & Fast)
*   **Framework:** HTML/CSS (Vanilla) or a lightweight framework (Astro/Next.js/Tailwind).
*   **Hosting:** Netlify or Vercel (Free/Cheap, fast, auto-SSL).
*   **Forms/Data:** Use a simple service (e.g., Formspree) or direct link to Checkout (Stripe Link).

### 6. Essential "Must-Haves" (Don't skip these)
*   **Mobile Check:** Does it look good on a phone?
*   **Speed:** Does it load in under 2 seconds? (Compress images!)
*   **Legal:** Footer links to Privacy Policy & Terms (Required by ad networks).
*   **Analytics:** Simple tracking (Google Analytics 4 or Plausible) to see Pageviews and Clicks.

## Phase 4: Launch & Learn

### 7. Go Live
*   Deploy to production URL.
*   Test the "Buy" button yourself with a real card (then refund).

### 8. Iterate
*   Look at the data after 100 visitors.
*   If they aren't scrolling, fix the Hero.
*   If they aren't clicking, fix the Offer.
*   **Keep it simple.** Don't over-engineer.
